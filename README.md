Here is my example of work with form and list of data.
Data are kept in JSON format.
There are the following features:
- possibility to add form data to existing list of data;
- adding and removing data from the page
- sorting of data on the page depending on value of select element
- searching of data on the page depending on value of search-field
- storage of data in LocalStorage
